# Molecular Dynamics Tutorial for Beginners

This site hosts interactive notebooks for a beginner-friendly Molecular Dynamics (MD) course.

Use the launch buttons at the top of each page to run notebooks on Binder.

## About This Course
- Audience: beginners starting MD from first principles.
- Style: concept-first explanations with runnable notebook examples.
- Tooling: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and ASE-based demonstrations.
- Goal: build intuition first, then introduce practical enhanced-sampling workflows.

## How To Use The Site
1. Start from Module 1 and go in order.
2. Read the markdown explanations first, then run code cells.
3. For interactive execution online, use Binder launch buttons on each page.
4. If a notebook is computationally heavy, use the notebook's fast-mode settings (where available).

## Course Modules
- 1. Introduction to MD
- 2. Physics of MD
- 3. Non-bonded interactions
- 4. 1D simulations
- 5. Sampling challenge and CVs
- 6. Umbrella sampling and WHAM
